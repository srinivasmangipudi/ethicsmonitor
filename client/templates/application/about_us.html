				"Photojournalism has no Bible, no rabbinical college, no Pope to define correct choices. There is no sole arbiter of what is or isn't ethical, and even if there were, the line isn't always black and white." - Kenneth Kobré

			Photography, after the introduction to the ethereal world of electronics has undergone a revolution that has extreme implications on the moral and ethical, as well as the legal and professional dimensions of photography. The digital revolution offers empowerment and opportunity, along with a range of new problems such as digital manipulation, legal status of ownership rights over images, intellectual property rights, reproduction rights, right to freedom, and the right to privacy.
		</p>
		<p>
			Photographers, journalists, and artists, too encounter these ethical challenges in their professional and personal lives. Though not easy, but often, an answer to such challenges may emerge from brainstorming or intense discussions. Do we have a framework of ethics and morals on creating and consuming photography in India? Are ethics and morals the same? Are ethics and laws consistent in India? Should ethics be sacrificed for the higher good of the society? Do professional ethics in one discipline conflict and contradict with ethical conduct of another discipline? Can a voluntary ethical and moral framework be developed for use by photographers in India?

			Ethical dilemmas have been encountered in many areas of photography and have at times been the subject of much controversy. Despite this, the problem of how to tackle ethical dilemmas has received little attention. As a result, photographers faced with these dilemmas have little knowledge to draw upon, and photography groups and organisations are not fully equiped to tackle all the issues involved in dealing with ethical dilemmas.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Ethical Monitor website has been created by Goa-CAP with the objective to helpphotographers to overcome the ethical dilemmas in their creations by getting them democratically decided by public.
		</p>
		<p>
			Every individual has the right to vote and write a 300 word supporting text stating why “s/he decides to make that choice”. These votes get accrued and the ethical value is shown in the format of right or wrong over the image. This platform is only suggestive and not judgmental and the final verdict of the dilemma rests with the creator of the image.
